In the dynamic realm of healthcare technology, accurate disease prediction remains 
paramount for effective treatment. Our project endeavors to craft a versatile 
Multilingual Chatbot for symptom analysis, employing cutting-edge tools such as the 
BERT model and Googletrans within a user-friendly Flask web interface. By 
harnessing the power of BERT, pre-trained and fine-tuned on a custom dataset, our 
chatbot excels in understanding user-input symptoms, transcending mere keyword 
matching to grasp nuanced contextual nuances. This not only enhances prediction 
accuracy but also fosters greater reliability in disease identification. The chatbot 
seamlessly supports interactions in English, Hindi, and Telugu, thanks to the 
integration of Googletrans, thus catering to diverse linguistic preferences. Through 
intuitive UI design and advanced natural language processing capabilities, our project 
aims to empower users to articulate their symptoms effectively, facilitating more 
informed healthcare decisions. By amalgamating state-of-the-art technology with user 
centric design principles, our Multilingual Chatbot for symptom analysis stands poised 
to revolutionize disease prediction, offering a robust solution in the quest for improved 
healthcare outcomes. Keywords- BERT, Goggle Trans, UI, HealthCare.
